I am a data engineering consultant specializing in helping people bring data driven products to market. I have enabled clients to deliver projects that range from in-memory product recommendation algorithms to big data systems using Kafka and Hadoop which process terabytes of server logs a day. Previously, I have worked at [Etsy.com](http://www.etsy.com), the [ACASA Lab](http://www.acasa.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as several early stage startups.
